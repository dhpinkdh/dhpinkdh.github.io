				<p>I am originally from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, but now live in the greater NYC area.</p>
				<p>On weekends, you can find me drawing, playing video games, messing with my cats, reading my kindle, all while drinking wine. I previously co-hosted the podcast <a href="http://5by5.tv/gettingthere">Getting There</a> on the <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Network</a>. I also love drawing and painting in my spare time, you can see my latest artwork on <a href="https://instagram.com/sarastewartwork">Instagram</a>.</p>
