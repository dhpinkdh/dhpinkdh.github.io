title: PRIALT Rinse and Fill (IFU) Animation
role: Art Director, Medical Director, Illustrator, Copywriter
description: I created the storyboard, script, final artwork, and acted as art director with a graphic designer who laid out all the final assets. This Instructions for Use (IFU) animation is for physicians who are prescribing PRIALT to their patients. It is an in depth overview of how to properly rinse and fill the device for first use. This animation was created with a voice over for use on an ipad, but can also be viewed on **[their website](http://www.prialt.com/hcp/starting-on-prialt/priming-and-filling-the-pump)**.
