title: Opioid Induced Constipation Poster for Salix
role: Art Director, Medical Director, Illustrator, Copywriter
description: I created the original sketch of the poster layout, wrote and referenced all copy, and created the final artwork. I then worked with a graphic designer who laid out the final design with my art direction. This is a patient-friendly poster to help explain how opioids may lead to opioid-induced constipation. A Bristol stool chart is included in order to help facilitate in-office conversations with their doctor.
