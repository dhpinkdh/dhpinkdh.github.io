title: Opioid Induced Constipation Poster for Salix
role: Art Director, Medical Director, Illustrator, Copywriter
description: This is a patient-friendly poster to help explain how opioids can lead to constipation. A bristol stool chart is included in order to help facilitate in-office conversations with their doctor. I created the original sketch of the poster layout, wrote and referenced all copy, and created the final artwork. I then worked with a graphic desinger who laid out the final design with my direction.
