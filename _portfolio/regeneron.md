title: REGENERON Eye Model
role: Art Director, Medical Director, Illustrator, 3D Artist
description: I created the original concept of the model with a sketch, which was then translated into a digital rendering (seen below). Once the project was approved, I created the final 3D anatomy in Maya and Zbrush, decorated the anatomy, completed final artwork for the overlay cards and worked with the client to reference the 5 most common retinal diseases. This model is a cross sectional view of healthy ocular anatomy. Overlay cards housed in the base are placed over the eye and contain imagery that shows macro and micro views of five common retinal diseases. Topics include dry age-related macular degeneration, wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema, central retinal vein occlusion, and branch retinal vein occlusion.
