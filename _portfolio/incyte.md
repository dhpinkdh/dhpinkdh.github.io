title: Polycythemia Vera Models for Incyte
role: Art Director, Medical Director, Illustrator
description: The purpose of these models is to showcase the difference between normal blood flow and blood flow with Polycythemia Vera. Finished products include an interactive desktop version and large scale convention piece that is now housed at Incyte Headquarters. I created original concept sketches, gave medical direction, and used Maya to create the procedural rendered backgrounds based on knowledge of hematocrit levels. Renders were touched up in Photoshop, where white blood cells and platelets were added.
