title: PRIALT's Mechanism of Action 3D Animation
role: Art Director, Medical Director
description: PRIALT®'s mechanism of action is complex and I set out to make the story a bit easier to understand with the help of an animation. This animation is intended for physicians to better understand PRIALT®'s therapeutic value in pain relief compared to opioids. I was responsible for creating outlines, storyboards, and 3D models. I also acted as art director when working with the 3D medical animator - Victoria Rompilla, to complete this animation.
