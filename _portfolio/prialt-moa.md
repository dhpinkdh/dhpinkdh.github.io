title: PRIALT<sup>®</sup>'s Mechanism of Action 3D Animation
role: Art Director, Medical Director
description: I was responsible for creating the outline, storyboard, script, and 3D models. I also acted as art director when working with the 3D medical animator to complete this animation. PRIALT’s mechanism of action is complex and I set out to make the story a bit easier to understand with the help of an animation. This animation is intended for physicians to better understand PRIALT’s therapeutic value in pain relief compared to opioids. This animation was created with a voice over for use on an ipad, but can also be viewed on **[their website](http://www.prialt.com/hcp/what-is-prialt)**.
