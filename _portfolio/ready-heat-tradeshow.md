title: Ready-Heat TMB Tradeshow Animation
role: Art Director, 3D Artist, Animator
description: I created the storyboard, script, 3D animation, final artwork, and acted as art director with a graphic designer who laid out all the final assets. This tradeshow animation features key product highlights, and showcases the full body, and half body blankets. Short animations show how the blankets work as well as where they are placed on the body. This animation was made in collaboration with the **[Ready-Heat sell sheet](/portfolio/ready-heat-sell-sheet.html)**.
