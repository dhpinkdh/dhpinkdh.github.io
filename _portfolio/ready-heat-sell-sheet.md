title: Ready-Heat Tempturature Management Blanket (TMB) Sell Sheet
role: Art Director, Medical Director, Illustrator, Copywriter
description: I created the original outline, copy, artwork, and acted as an art director to help a graphic designer lay out the final sell sheet. This sell sheet was made in collaboration with the **[Ready-Heat tradeshow animation](/portfolio/ready-heat-tradeshow.html)**. It contains a rendering of the blanket on a figure (from the animation), an overview of product highlights as well as product specifications for the Temperature Management Blanket Line.
