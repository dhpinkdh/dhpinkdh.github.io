role: UX and UI Designer, Medical Director, Illustrator, Copywriter
description: My responsibilities included all the content (artwork, copywriting, UX and UI) for the patient education modules of the XARELTO<sup>®</sup> DocCenter Application. I specifically worked on the hip and knee replacement surgery modules, as well as re-designed the layout and content for the deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism module. The XARELTO<sup>®</sup> DocCenter Application is a large app which contains prescribing information, resources, videos, and patient education modules. Wireframes are shown below, along with final screenshots from an ipad.
